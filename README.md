# Gess_Game
An abstract strategy board game called Gess.

According to https://www.chessvariants.com/crossover.dir/gess.html
"Gess was invented by the Puzzles and Games Ring of the Archimedeans Mathematics Society, which is the mathematical society of Cambridge University (UK). The rules were first published, together with a sample game, by Paul Bolchover in Eureka, Vol. 53, the periodical of the Archimedeans."

The complete rules are found here:

The player's game piece constists of a 3x3 group of stones that move as a unit. The way the player's piece can move depends on the configuration of the stones in the selected piece. Please see the rules for a detailed explanation of piece movement.  When a piece's move causes it to overlap stones, all stones covered by the footprint get removed, not just those covered by one of the piece's stones. It is not legal to make a move that leaves you without a ring. It is possible for a player to have more than one ring. A player does not lose until they have no remaining rings.

The game board is a 20x20 grid.  The center of the piece being moved must stay within the boundaries of rows and columns 2-19. An edge of the piece may go into columns or rows 1 or 20, but all stones there will be removed at the end of the move. Black goes first.
